You can now upload videos of any length to self-hosted sites—the only limit is your own imagination. (Oh, and the 2 GB file size limit, we guess.)

When you Follow Conversation in Reader post cards and post details, in-app notifications are now opt-out rather than opt-in.

We replaced the quick-start prompt when you log in as an existing user. Now you can tell us what you’d like to focus on and enable notifications for things like site traffic, new followers, and other milestones. Cue confetti.

Ready for the grand tour? We made some tweaks to the Stats and Reader tours in the Quick Start section. Now you can move through the tours more smoothly and get more pointers and messages as you go.

We also made some sweet, sweet changes to the Block Editor.

- You can now adjust Featured Image settings for any posts in a Latest Post block.
- You’ll see the correct notices when you’re fast-switching between HTML and Visual mode.
- Media previews are no longer cut off when you edit a URL in an Embed block.
- If you’re using an iPad with an external keyboard, you’ll no longer see extra space between the toolbar and the bottom of the screen. Mind the gap.
